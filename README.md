# OverWebProjector
The OverWebProjector turns a smartphone into an overhead projector for the digital age. The OWP is a fixed-geometry modular holder made of common pvc pipes, a gym weight, an LED light and few 3D printed parts. It is designed especially for the distance learning needs of K-12 and secondary education, as it allows to preserve the student's analog workspace and bridge it to online video-communication services.
